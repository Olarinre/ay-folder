                            The growing financial and economic challenges faced by students and tertiary institutions change by the day. The advisory and consultancy services designed by Quest-Inspie mitigate these challenges. With the deep insight and knowledge about the operations of tertiary institutions and organisations, we are able to determine the exact administrative support and redundancies that make it easier to manage these scarce resources efficiently.

                            <p class ="technical info">Quest-Inspire Tutoring Service offers a wide range of academic subjects. Sessions can be set up as private or students may form groups for tutoring. Private sessions offer intense individual assistance, but groups sessions can also be beneficial with decreased economic costs and the use of team-based approach that the business program encourages. For The Atkinson-based courses, Quest-Inspire Tutoring Service offers an extensive collection of past exams which are invaluable for teaching the material and for exam preparation. For all students, Quest-Inspire Tutoring Service uses the Systematic Analysis Framework (SAF). This unique problem solving approach taught to students provides a system to approach all topics that they encounter in school. This system seeks to provide the student with a way in which they can better solve their own queries. This system differs from most tutors who are primarily concerned with answering the students immediate questions and not concerned with providing the students with basic problem solving skills for future applications.</p>
